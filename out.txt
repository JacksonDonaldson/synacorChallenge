could it possibly havestrange bookThe cover of this book subtly swirls with colors  It is titled A Brief Introduction to Interdimensional Physics  It readsRecent advances in interdimensional physics have produced fascinatingpredictions about the fundamentals of our universe  For exampleinterdimensional physics seems to predict that the universe is at its root apurely mathematical construct and that all events are caused by theinteractions between eight pockets of energy called registersFurthermore it seems that while the lower registers primarily control mundanethings like sound and light the highest register the socalled eighthregister is used to control interdimensional events such as teleportationA hypothetical such teleportation device would need to have have exactly twodestinations  One destination would be used when the eighth register is at itsminimum energy level  this would be the default operation assuming the userhas no way to control the eighth register  In this situation the teleportershould send the user to a preconfigured safe location as a defaultThe second destination however is predicted to require a very specificenergy level in the eighth register  The teleporter must take great care toconfirm that this energy level is exactly correct before teleporting its userIf it is even slightly off the user would probably arrive at the correctlocation but would briefly experience anomalies in the fabric of realityitself  this is of course not recommended  Any teleporter would need to testthe energy level in the eighth register and abort teleportation if it is notexactly correctThis required precision implies that the confirmation mechanism would be verycomputationally expensive  While this would likely not be an issue for largescale teleporters a hypothetical handheld teleporter would take billions ofyears to compute the result and confirm that the eighth register is correctIf you find yourself trapped in an alternate dimension with nothing but ahandheld teleporter you will need to extract the confirmation algorithmreimplement it on more powerful hardware and optimize it  This should at thevery least allow you to determine the value of the eighth register which wouldhave been accepted by the teleporters confirmation mechanismThen set the eighth register to this value activate the teleporter andbypass the confirmation mechanism  If the eighth register is set correctly noanomalies should be experienced but beware  if it is set incorrectly thenowbypassed confirmation mechanism will not protect youOf course since teleportation is impossible this is all totally ridiculousjournalFireflies were using this dusty old journal as a resting spot until you scared them off  It readsDay  We have reached what seems to be the final in a series of puzzles guarding an ancient treasure  I suspect most adventurers give up long before this point but were so close  We must press onDay  PS Its a good thing the island is tropical  We should have food for weeksDay  The vault appears to be sealed by a mysterious force  the door wont budge an inch  We dont have the resources to blow it open and I wouldnt risk damaging the contents even if we did  Well have to figure out the lock mechanismDay  The door to the vault has a number carved into it  Each room leading up to the vault has more numbers or symbols embedded in mosaics in the floors  We even found a strange glass orb in the antechamber on a pedestal itself labeled with a number  What could they meanDay  We finally built up the courage to touch the strange orb in the antechamber  It flashes colors as we carry it from room to room and sometimes the symbols in the rooms flash colors as well  It simply evaporates if we try to leave with it but another appears on the pedestal in the antechamber shortly thereafter  It also seems to do this even when we return with it to the antechamber from the other roomsDay  When the orb is carried to the vault door the numbers on the door flash black and then the orb evaporates  Did we do something wrong  Doesnt the door like us  We also found a small hourglass near the door endlessly running  Is it waiting for somethingDay  Some of my crew swear the orb actually gets heaver or lighter as they walk around with it  Is that even possible  They say that if they walk through certain rooms repeatedly they feel it getting lighter and lighter but it eventually just evaporates and a new one appears as usualDay  Now I can feel the orb changing weight as I walk around  It depends on the area  the change is very subtle in some places but certainly more noticeable in others especially when I walk into a room with a larger number or out of a room marked   Perhaps we can actually control the weight of this mysterious orbDay  One of the crewmembers was wandering the rooms today and claimed that the numbers on the door flashed white as he approached  He said the door still didnt open but he noticed that the hourglass had run out and flashed black  When we went to check on it it was still running like it always does  Perhaps he is going mad  If not which do we need to appease the door or the hourglass  BothDay  The fireflies are getting suspicious  One of them looked at me funny today and then flew off  I think I saw another one blinking a little faster than usual  Or was it a little slower  We are getting better at controlling the weight of the orb and we think thats what the numbers are all about  The orb starts at the weight labeled on the pedestal and goes down as we leave a room marked  up as we leave a room marked  and up even more as we leave a room marked   Entering rooms with larger numbers has a greater effectDay  Every once in a great while one of the crewmembers has the same story that the door flashes white the hourglass had already run out it flashes black and the orb evaporates  Are we too slow  We cant seem to find a way to make the orbs weight match what the door wants before the hourglass runs out  If only we could find a shorter route through the roomsDay  We are abandoning the mission  None of us can work out the solution to the puzzle  I will leave this journal here to help future adventurers though I am not sure what help it will give  Good
